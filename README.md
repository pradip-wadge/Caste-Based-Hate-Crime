Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Processed raw data to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.
Organized datasets for accurate and meaningful analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified key metrics like crime frequency, regional distribution, and time trends.
Highlighted relationships between various factors influencing caste-based crimes.
Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit):

Users can explore data dynamically with filters like crime type, location, and time period.
Visualizations of crime statistics using charts and graphs for better insights.
Insights and Reporting:

Generated actionable insights for reducing caste-based hate crimes.
Provided statistical summaries to guide policymaking and awareness campaigns.
